The script should: - Extract content while preserving structure. - Modify tables and text as per the instructions. - The modifications should be done within the file present at /Users/saish/Downloads/POC_Nhilent/nihilentpoc/word-file.pdf. - The modifications should be combined with the original file content. - After modfications save the pdf as new.pdf - Include robust error handling and logging.\n",
      "1.  **Analyze the PDF Structure:** The Senior Python Developer should first analyze the PDF structure to understand how text and tables are organized. This could involve initial manual inspection or using a PDF library to explore the document's content. \n",
      "2.  **Choose PDF Processing Library:** Select a suitable Python library for PDF manipulation. Popular choices include `PyPDF2`, `pdfplumber`, or `tabula-py`.  The choice depends on the complexity of the PDF and the need to extract tables accurately. `PyPDF2` is suitable for basic text and page manipulation, while `pdfplumber` and `tabula-py` excel at table extraction.\n",
      "3.  **Install Necessary Libraries:** Install the chosen library using pip. For example: `pip install PyPDF2` or `pip install pdfplumber tabula-py`. The Senior Python Developer should list all needed libraries in the code.\n",
      "4.  **Write Python Script:** The Senior Python Developer will write a Python script to:\n",
      "    *   **Import Libraries:** Import the necessary libraries (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `pdfplumber`, `tabula`).\n",
      "    *   **Define File Paths:** Define the input PDF file path (`/Users/saish/Downloads/POC_Nhilent/nihilentpoc/word-file.pdf`) and the output PDF file path (`new.pdf`).\n",
      "    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions such as file not found errors, incorrect file format, or issues during PDF processing.\n",
      "    *   **Extract Content:** Use the chosen PDF library to extract text and tables from the PDF. The script should preserve the original structure as much as possible. If using `pdfplumber` or `tabula-py` for table extraction, ensure that the extracted tables are in a usable format (e.g., lists of lists or pandas DataFrames).\n",
      "    *   **Modify Tables/Text:** Locate the 'Name of Person(s) Travelling' column within the extracted tables or text. Append \"Saish (Male)\" to the existing content in this column for each row or instance.\n",
      "    *   **Combine Modifications:** If the PDF library allows direct modification, the changes should be applied directly to the PDF object. If direct modification isn't possible, reassemble the extracted content (modified tables and original text) into a new PDF file.\n",
      "    *   **Save Modified PDF:** Save the modified PDF to the specified output file path (`new.pdf`).\n",

      "1.  **Receive Python Script:** The Secure Python Code Execution Agent will receive the Python script from the Senior Python Developer.\n",
      "2.  **Prepare Execution Environment:** The agent will use the Code Interpreter tool. The agent will prepare the execution environment by installing all required libraries which are listed in the python script.\n",
      "3.  **Execute the Script:** The agent will use the Code Interpreter tool to execute the Python script. The agent will provide the code as input to the tool.\n",
      "4.  **Monitor Execution:** The agent will monitor the execution process for any errors. The agent will capture all output from the script, including any error messages or log messages.\n",

      "7.  **Generate Execution Report:** The agent will generate a detailed execution report that includes:\n",
