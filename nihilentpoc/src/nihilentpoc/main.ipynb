The script should: - Modify text and table contents according to Make changes to the Name of Person(s)Travelling column in the file by adding name Saish to it with male gender while preserving the file structure. - Use the directory_tool if the file path is not found - Modify tables, text, or any specified content as per user instructions. - Ensure that modifications seamlessly integrate with the existing content without altering the document's formatting. - Implement robust error handling, logging, and validation to prevent data loss or corruption. -In the code The final modified PDF should be saved as the the directory path of the directory_tool /new.pdf . Example: if the directory path is /Users/saish/Downloads/POC_Nhilent/nihilentpoc/src/nihilentpoc then store the modified PDF as /Users/saish/Downloads/POC_Nhilent/nihilentpoc/src/nihilentpoc/new.pdf\n",
